# Sudoku
Solve simple yet complex math problems.

## Introduce
The name Sudoku comes from Japan.  
'su' means a number and 'doku' means single, so it's a game to avoid duplicate numbers.  
Basically, it is played on a 9 x 9 board, and it is a game of filling in all the numbers from 1 to 9 in a 3 x 3 grid, horizontally and vertically so that they do not overlap.
