# Sudoku
### This is very simple yet very difficult. This is a game to solve such math problems.

## Introduce
Sudoku is a Japanese word that is a compound word of 'su' meaning number and 'doku' meaning single.  
As the name of the game suggests, it is a game where you fill in all the numbers without overlapping them.  
A 9 * 9 board is common, and all you have to do is fill in all the numbers from 1 to 9 in 3 x 3 grids, horizontally and vertically.
